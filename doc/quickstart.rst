Quick Start
===========

This page gives a quick introduction to Flask-SuperAdmin library. It is assumed that reader has some prior
knowledge of the `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ framework.

Introduction
------------

While developing the library, I attempted to make it as flexible as possible. Developers should
not monkey-patch anything to achieve desired functionality.

The library uses one simple, but powerful concept - administrative pieces are built as classes with
view methods.

Below is an absolutely valid administrative piece::

    class MyView(BaseView):
        @expose('/')
        def index(self):
            return self.render('admin/myindex.html')

        @expose('/test/')
        def test(self):
            return self.render('admin/test.html')

So, how does it help in structuring administrative interface? With such building blocks, you're
implementing reusable functional pieces that are highly customizable.

For example, Flask-SuperAdmin provides ready-to-use SQLAlchemy, Mongoengine and Django model interface. 
For SQLAlchemy it is implemented as a
class which accepts two parameters: a model and a database session, otherwise just the model parameter.

While it exposes some
class-level variables which change behavior of the interface (somewhat similar to django.contrib.admin),
nothing prohibits you from overriding form creation logic, database access methods or extending existing
functionality.

Initialization
--------------

To start using Flask-SuperAdmin, you have to create :class:`~flask.ext.superadmin.base.Admin` class instance and associate it with the Flask
application instance::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.superadmin import Admin

    app = Flask(__name__)

    admin = Admin(app)
    # Add administrative views here

    app.run()

If you start this application and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/admin/ <http://localhost:5000/admin/>`_,
you should see empty "Home" page with a navigation bar on top

    .. image:: images/quickstart/quickstart_1.png
        :target: ../_images/quickstart_1.png

You can change application name by passing `name` parameter to the :class:`~flask.ext.superadmin.base.Admin` class constructor::

    admin = Admin(app, name='My App')

Name is displayed in the menu section.

You don't have to pass the Flask application object to the constructor - you can call :meth:`~flask.ext.superadmin.base.Admin.init_app` later::

    admin = Admin(name='My App')
    # Add views here
    admin.init_app(app)

Adding views
------------

Now, lets add an administrative view. To do this, you need to derive from :class:`~flask.ext.superadmin.base.BaseView` class::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.superadmin import Admin, BaseView, expose

    class MyView(BaseView):
        @expose('/')
        def index(self):
            return self.render('index.html')

    app = Flask(__name__)

    admin = Admin(app)
    admin.add_view(MyView(name='Hello'))

    app.run()

If you run this example, you will see that menu has two items: Home and Hello.

Each view class should have default page - view method with '/' url. Following code won't work::

    class MyView(BaseView):
        @expose('/index/')
        def index(self):
            return self.render('index.html')

Now, create the `templates` directory and then create new `index.html` file with following content::

    {% extends 'admin/master.html' %}
    {% block body %}
        Hello World from MyView!
    {% endblock %}

All administrative pages should derive from the 'admin/master.html' to maintain same look and feel.

If you refresh the 'Hello' administrative page again you should see the greeting in the content section.

    .. image:: images/quickstart/quickstart_2.png
        :width: 640
        :target: ../_images/quickstart_2.png

You're not limited to the top level menu. It is possible to pass a category name and it will be used as a
top menu item. For example::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.superadmin import Admin, BaseView, expose

    class MyView(BaseView):
        @expose('/')
        def index(self):
            return self.render('index.html')

    app = Flask(__name__)

    admin = Admin(app)
    admin.add_view(MyView(name='Hello 1', endpoint='test1', category='Test'))
    admin.add_view(MyView(name='Hello 2', endpoint='test2', category='Test'))
    admin.add_view(MyView(name='Hello 3', endpoint='test3', category='Test'))
    app.run()

Will look like this:

    .. image:: images/quickstart/quickstart_3.png
        :width: 640
        :target: ../_images/quickstart_3.png

Authentication
--------------

By default, the administrative interface is visible to everyone, as Flask-SuperAdmin does not make
any assumptions about the authentication system you're using.

If you want to control access to the administrative views, derive from the
administrative view class and implement the `is_accessible` method. So, if you use Flask-Login and
want to expose the administrative interface only to logged in users, you can do something like
this::

    class MyView(BaseView):
        def is_accessible(self):
            return login.current_user.is_authenticated()


You can implement policy-based security, conditionally allow or disallow access to parts of the
administrative interface and if user does not have access to the view, he won't see the menu item
as well.

Generating URLs
---------------

Internally, view classes work on top of Flask blueprints, so you can use `url_for` with a dot
prefix to get URL to a local view::

    from flask import url_for

    class MyView(BaseView):
        @expose('/')
        def index(self)
            # Get URL for the test view method
            url = url_for('.test')
            return self.render('index.html', url=url)

        @expose('/test/')
        def test(self):
            return self.render('test.html')

If you want to generate URL to the particular view method from outside, the following rules apply:

1. You have the ability to override an endpoint name by passing the `endpoint` parameter to the view class
constructor::

    admin = Admin(app)
    admin.add_view(MyView(endpoint='testadmin'))

In this case, you can generate links by concatenating the view method name with a endpoint::

    url_for('testadmin.index')

2. If you don't override the endpoint name, it will use the lower case representation of the class name. For the previous example,
the code to get the URL will look like this::

    url_for('myview.index')

3. For model-based views, the rule is different - it will take the model class name, if an endpoint name
is not provided. Model-based views will be explained in the next section.


Model Views
-----------

Flask-SuperAdmin comes with built-in SQLAlchemy model administrative interface. It is very easy to use::

    from flask.ext.superadmin import Admin

    # Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy initialization here

    admin = Admin(app)
    admin.register(User, session=db.session)

This will create administrative interface for `User` model with default settings.

Here is how the default list view looks like:

    .. image:: images/quickstart/quickstart_4.png
        :width: 640
        :target: ../_images/quickstart_4.png

If you want to customize model views, you have two options:

1. Change the behavior by overriding public properties that control how view works
2. Change the behavior by overriding methods

For example, if you want to disable model creation and show only the 'login' and 'email' columns in the list view,
you can do something like this::

    from flask.ext.superadmin import Admin, model

    # Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy initialization here

    class UserModel(model.ModelAdmin):
        session = db.session
        list_display = ('username','email')

    admin = Admin(app)
    admin.register(User, UserModel)


It is relatively easy to add support for different database backends by inheriting from :class:`~flask.ext.superadmin.model.BaseModelAdmin`.
class and implementing database-related methods.

Please refer to :mod:`flask.ext.superadmin.model.mongoengine` documentation on how to customize behavior of model-based administrative views.

File Admin
----------

Flask-SuperAdmin comes with another handy battery - file admin. It gives you ability to manage files on your server (upload, delete, rename, etc).

Here is a simple example::

    from flask.ext.superadmin import Admin
    from flask.ext.superadmin.contrib.fileadmin import FileAdmin

    import os.path as op

    # Flask setup here

    admin = Admin(app)

    path = op.join(op.dirname(__file__), 'static')
    admin.add_view(FileAdmin(path, '/static/', name='Static Files'))

Sample screenshot:

    .. image:: images/quickstart/quickstart_5.png
        :width: 640
        :target: ../_images/quickstart_5.png

You can disable uploads, disable file or directory deletion, restrict file uploads to certain types and so on.
Check :mod:`flask.ext.superadmin.contrib.fileadmin` documentation on how to do it.
